# Blockchain-Technology

In this project, a honey distribution system using blockchain technology is realized.
The system consists of a peer-to-peer network of honey sellers and buyers. By
utilizing a user interface, it is demonstrated that a honey seller could list his/her
honey product for selling. A buyer could then select a honey product from the
list of available honey products. Once a honey product is selected for buying, a
transaction is generated and a verification procedure is executed. After verifying
available transactions, a block is created and a mining procedure is performed.
Finally, it is shown that the new block is added to the existing blockchain and is
distributed to everyone in the network to complete a transaction.
